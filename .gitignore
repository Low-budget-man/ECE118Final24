# The .gitignore will ignore any file that is discribed here is the docs https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore
# After you edit this file you will run:
# git reset .
# git add .
# git status
# these commands will show what files you will add to the next commit (helpful for seeing if your gitignore sintax is correct)
# if you have a file that you have accidentally tracked and want to remove it form the git repo after ignoreing it you run
# git rm -rf --cached .
# git add .
# if you do this your next commit will have the file gone
# Files to be ignored -------------------------
